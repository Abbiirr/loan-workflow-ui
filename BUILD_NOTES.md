The project was originally scaffolded with Vite (see remaining files: vite.config.ts, tsconfig.app.json). It has been transitioned in package.json to use Create React App (react-scripts) per provided specification.

Implications:

- vite.config.ts is now unused by npm start (react-scripts start).
- TypeScript config may include Vite specific settings; CRA expects tsconfig.json at root. Adjust if compile issues arise.
- Remove unused dependencies from prior setup (vite, @vitejs/plugin-react, etc.) if still present in lockfile.
- To fully migrate, delete vite.config.ts and any Vite specific scripts; or revert package.json if Vite should remain.

Next Steps (choose one):

1. Continue with CRA: remove Vite artifacts, add public/index.html template if missing.
2. Revert to Vite: restore previous package.json and keep optimized dev server.

Currently, index.html (for Vite) exists; CRA expects public/index.html plus src/index.tsx root element 'root'. Ensure proper HTML structure if starting CRA dev server.

You may need to add a public/index.html matching CRA template for the app to load correctly under react-scripts.
