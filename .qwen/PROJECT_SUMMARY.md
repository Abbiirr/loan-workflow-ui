# Project Summary

## Overall Goal
To improve the visual clarity of workflow graphs in the Loan Workflow UI by implementing cleaner layout algorithms and edge routing to reduce overlaps and entanglement.

## Key Knowledge
- The project uses React Flow for graph visualization
- Two layout algorithms have been implemented: Dagre and ELK
- Dagre provides fast, hierarchical layouts; ELK offers advanced layout options with orthogonal edge routing
- Utility functions for both algorithms are located in `src/utils/`
- The WorkflowGraph component has been updated to include layout controls
- Users can select between "No Layout", "Dagre Layout", and "ELK Layout" via a dropdown

## Recent Actions
- Analyzed the current React Flow configuration in WorkflowGraph.tsx
- Researched layout algorithms (Dagre and ELK) to reduce edge overlaps
- Implemented Dagre layout algorithm in `src/utils/dagreLayout.ts`
- Implemented ELK layout algorithm in `src/utils/elkLayout.ts`
- Updated WorkflowGraph component to include layout selection controls
- Added useEffect hook to apply layouts when nodes are initialized or layout type changes

## Current Plan
1. [DONE] Investigate current React Flow layout configuration in WorkflowGraph.tsx
2. [DONE] Research React Flow layout options (Dagre, Elk, custom layouts)
3. [DONE] Implement a cleaner layout algorithm to reduce edge overlaps
4. [IN PROGRESS] Adjust node positioning and edge routing for better visual separation
5. [TODO] Research edge routing options (different edge types, connection line styles, custom edge components)
6. [TODO] Implement improved edge routing to complement the layout algorithms
