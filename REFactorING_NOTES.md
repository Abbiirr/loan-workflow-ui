# Refactor Notes

This document summarizes the refactoring work performed across the codebase to improve structure, maintainability, and TypeScript safety while preserving existing behavior.

## Goals

- Improve code quality and readability
- Split large components into smaller, reusable pieces
- Adopt consistent React + TypeScript best practices (Vite project)
- Remove deprecated or unsafe patterns (any casts, nested ternaries, unused imports)
- Keep behavior intact (refactor, not rewrite)

## Highlights by Area

### New Reusable Components

- src/components/TopBar.tsx
  - Reusable app header wrapper. Replaces duplicated header markup in App.
- src/components/graph/GraphToolbar.tsx
  - Toolbar for WorkflowGraph. Hosts actions like Export. Keeps graph view clean.
- src/components/table/ApplicationRow.tsx
  - Isolated row rendering logic for ApplicationTable to reduce inline complexity.
- src/components/form/FieldInput.tsx
  - Centralized renderer for form fields (text, number, select, textarea, file).

### New/Updated Utilities

- src/utils/graphExport.ts
  - exportGraphToJson utility and types for consistent graph export handling.
- src/utils/colors.ts
  - getStageColor for consistent status color mapping.

### Key Component Refactors

- src/components/WorkflowGraph.tsx
  - Delegated Export to GraphToolbar + graphExport utility.
  - Ensured edge labels used for export are strings to avoid ReactNode issues.
- src/App.tsx
  - Replaced ad-hoc headers with TopBar to unify layout and reduce duplication.
- src/components/ApplicationTable.tsx
  - Now maps to ApplicationRow for rows; simpler and easier to test.
- src/components/FormViewer.tsx
  - Uses FieldInput to render fields; handlers simplified and typed.
- src/components/Dashboard.tsx
  - Uses getStageColor utility for styling instead of hardcoded maps.
- src/components/DashboardHeader.tsx
  - Removed unused imports and tidied up.
- src/components/DetailPanel.tsx
  - Tightened types using workflow Field type. Eliminated any casts and nested ternaries.
  - Added helpers getFieldActions and splitOperations.
  - Guarded label rendering and operations parsing.

### Graph Parser Improvements

- src/utils/graphParser.ts
  - Removed unused type import.
  - Replaced nested ternary for stroke color with a small if/else block.
  - Left behavior unchanged: nodes from per-state definitions; edges from state Actions only.

## Type Safety & Linting

- Replaced many any/unknown casts with explicit types (NodeData, EdgeData, Field, etc.).
- Avoided nested ternaries and index keys where feasible; used stable composite keys.
- Removed unused imports and variables that caused build warnings.

## What Stayed the Same

- Overall UI and user flows.
- Data model for workflow, forms, and actions.
- Build tooling (Vite), ESLint baseline, TS strict config.

## Follow-ups / Ideas

- Add unit tests for graph parsing and export utilities.
- Consider extracting inline styles into CSS modules or Tailwind for consistency.
- Add E2E smoke test (e.g., Playwright) for graph interactions.
- Improve typing for ReactFlow node/edge data via generics.

## Verification

- Local typecheck/lint passes file-level checks for updated files.
- Build validation may require running npm scripts in an environment with Node/npm available.

If you'd like, I can run the full typecheck, lint, and build once npm is available in the terminal, or wire a CI workflow to enforce it automatically.
